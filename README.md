# Industrial Mindustry Mod 1.0
![GitHub Logo](/sprites/git/example_old_3.png)
This mod for Mindustry adds alternative ways to obtain materials such as iron, steel, oil refining, titanium and thorium. The mod also makes the endgame a bit more challenging.

To install this mod, you can use one of two methods:
- Method 1: Find the mods folder and move the mod folder into it.
- Method 2: Open Mindustry, go to the mods section, select import from GitHub and enter "Creator-Art-Life/Mod-Mindustry".

You can contact me via Telegram (maxim_paradise).

## Known Issues:
- Sometimes when you import this mod on android, minudstry crashes. Re-openning mindustry will fix the issue and the mod will be loaded.

## Important:
I took the pictures for the mod from the Internet.
I'm glad I learned how to build mods for Mindustry
