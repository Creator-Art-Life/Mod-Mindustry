This mod gives you iron, steel, aluminum, oil processing, and alternative ways of generating materials like titanium and thorium.

This new and improved version of Production Mod adds better sprites, better recipes, and most importantly, support for Mindustry v6! I'm not done porting it, but everything should be mostly working. I don't know how to add zones/maps/sectors to v6, but I'll probably get it working eventually. Also, the maps that I do add will be brand new ones, since I don't think the old ones are very good.
