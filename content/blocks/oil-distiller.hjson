/*
I didn't know how much this outputs so I did an experiment

Here's what I did:
1: set up an oil distiller connected directly to a liquid source set to oil and connected directly to a vault
2: place an infinite power node
3: disconnect power and place items voids to remove any items
4: take away item voids and set up a 5 minute timer
5: start timer and simultaneously connect the power node
6: wait until timer is done and immediately disconnect power

Here is what was in the vault at the end of the experiment:
752 Petroleum Containers
703 Light Oil Containers
781 Heavy Oil Containers
718 Sludge Containers

Conclusion:
The Oil Distiller gives 148 +- 7 items of each output type / minute or about 2.5 of each output type per second.
